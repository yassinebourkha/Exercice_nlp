        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Reuters-21578 dataset** is a collection of 21,578 financial news articles, curated to support tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, particularly text classification. Each article is tagged with one or more topics, enabling a variety of descriptive and predictive analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook focuses on the **descriptive analysis** of the dataset, aiming to uncover key patterns and characteristics of the data. The goal is to prepare and analyze the dataset for the subsequent task of developing a classification model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Dataset Overview:**\n",
        "- **Source**: The dataset consists of financial articles sourced from Reuters.\n",
        "- **Topics**: Although the dataset includes 135 topics, this exercise narrows the focus to **5 key topics**:\n",
        "  1. Money/Foreign Exchange (**MONEY-FX**)\n",
        "  2. Shipping (**SHIP**)\n",
        "  3. Interest Rates (**INTEREST**)\n",
        "  4. Mergers/Acquisitions (**ACQ**)\n",
        "  5. Earnings and Earnings Forecasts (**EARN**)\n",
        "- **Format**: The dataset is distributed across 22 `.sgm` files, with each file containing articles and associated metadata.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Objectives:**\n",
        "1. **Descriptive Analysis**:\n",
        "   - Explore the main characteristics of each topic.\n",
        "   - Identify key trends, such as the frequency of topics or the distribution of attributes like `Dateline`, `Title`, and `Body`.\n",
        "2. **Data Preparation**:\n",
        "   - Clean and preprocess the data for future modeling.\n",
        "   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Outcome:**\n",
        "By the end of this notebook, the dataset will be thoroughly explored and preprocessed, setting a solid foundation for the next phase: building a predictive model to classify articles into their respective topics.\n"
